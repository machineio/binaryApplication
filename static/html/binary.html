            <h4><b>What is a binary option?</b></h4>

            <p>A Binary Option is a vehicle that allows you to invest into the rate an asset is trading at vs the expiry time. The up and down nature of binary options makes it very easy to understand the mechanics of trading. There are none of the complications associated with traditional investments from leverage to spreads and exit points. Payouts are clearly set in advance, typically around 70% to 90% for every winning trade. Binary options are available 24/7 on a wide range of Currencies, Commodities, Indices and Stocks.</p>

             

            <h4><b>What is an underlying asset?</b></h4>

            <p>Underlying assets provide you access to commodities, indexes, stocks, currency pairs or any other financial asset that constitutes the basis for creating an option.</p>

             

            <h4><b>What is a call option?</b></h4>

            <p>This is an option that provides the holder with a profit when the trader speculates the asset rate will move above the predetermined fixed entry rate before expiry time.</p>

             

            <h4><b>What is a put option?</b></h4>

            <p>This is an option that provides the holder with a profit when the trader speculates the asset rate willmove below the predetermined fixed entry rate before expiry time.</p>

             

            <h4><b>How do you invest?</b></h4>

            <p>To invest, simply choose between CALL or PUT. A trader is watching the market and based on their analysis determines the direction the market is going, either higher or lower than what the current price of the asset is. After clicking on the call/put button, enter the amount you want to invest and approvethe execution. The selection may be cancelled by clicking on "X" at any time before approval of the transaction. Please note that the level keeps updating in the investment sheet.

            <h4><b>What return will I get for a successful investment?</b></h4>

            <p>A successful investment will result in a guaranteed return indicated on the site for the underlying assetthat you selected. Binary Machine typically offers you a 70% – 90% payout when the option expires in-the­money.</p>

             

            <h4><b>What return will I get in the event that the option expires out-of-the-money?</b></h4>

            <p>In the event that the option expires out­of­the­money, the majority of your investment amount will bededucted automatically from your account. You will however receive a percentage of your investment back.</p>

             

            <h4><b>What is the minimum amount to purchase a single option?</b></h4>

            <p>The minimum amount to purchase a single option is $25 USD</p>

             

            <h4><b>What is the maximum amount to purchase a single option?</b></h4>

            <p>The maximum amount to purchase a single option is $1,500 USD.</p>

            <p>In your account you will be able to comprehensively see your trading history by clicking History in My Account. Also you will be able to view your entire transaction history and past trades by clicking on My Portfolio. I tried to invest an amount for a single option, but received an error message telling me I exceeded the maximum investment amount. What should I do? If you wish to purchase options for greater amounts than 1,500 EUR/USD, you will have to purchase an option at this maximum amount, and then purchase an additional option, and so on. Multipleoptions may be purchased, one following the other, allowing you to effectively invest an unlimited amount per asset.</p>

            <h4><b>What are the levels displayed in the trading boxes?</b></h4>

            <p>The level is the quoted price for an option of an underlying asset. The level changes and is updated frequently according to different parameters that Binary Machine proprietary algorithms take into account. The levels we present in the trading boxes are those at which Binary Machine is willing to sell options, and are Reuters real time market levels.</p>

            <h4><b>What is the expiry level?</b></h4>

            <p>The expiry time is the rate of the underlying asset at the time of expiry of the asset according to Reuters. This is the determining rate with regards to whether the option has expired in­the­money or out­of­the­money. A different expiry time is determined for each underlying asset.</p>

            <h4><b>What happens if the expiry level of a given asset is identical to the level at which the transaction was made?</b></h4>

            <p>In this event, the amount of the investment is returned to the customer.</p>

            <h4><b>What is the difference between purchasing options in Binary Machine and buying put and/or call options in the stock market?</b></h4>

            <p>The options available in Binary Machine are binary options. They are different to standard (vanilla) option chains that are offered by stock exchanges. The latter typically have longer expiry dates and significantly fluctuating yields. Binary options have a fixed return and are offered for different expiry points from the end of a minute to the end of a year.</p>

            <h4><b>What is the time zone of the expiry time?</b></h4>

            <p>The site’s trading hours and expiry times are given in GMT (i.e. London’s time zone).</p>
