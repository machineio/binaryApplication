            <h4>What is a binary option?</h4>

            <p>Binaries are extremely simple to use and understand in terms of functionality, also referred to as a digital option or a fixed return option.  This is because the option has an expiry date/time and also what is called a strike price whereby payout is determined at the onset of the contract. You receive a fixed amount of cash if the option expires in-the-money, regardless of how much the price of the underlying asset moves by. However, you lose the majority of your investment when the option expires out-of-the-money. The strike price, expiry, payout and risk are all disclosed at the outset of the trade.</p>

             

            <h4>What is an underlying asset?</h4>

            <p>Underlying assets provide you access to commodities, indexes, stocks, currency pairs or any other financial asset that constitutes the basis for creating an option.</p>

             

            <h4>What is a call option?</h4>

            <p>This is an option that provides the holder with a profit when the underlying asset increases in price compared to the level it was purchased at.</p>

             

            <h4>What is a put option?</h4>

            <p>This is an option that provides the holder with a profit when the underlying asset decreases in price compared to the level it was purchased at.</p>

             

            <h4>How do you invest?</h4>

            <p>To invest, simply choose between CALL or PUT. A trader is watching the market and based on their analysis determines the direction the market is going, either higher or lower than what the current price of the asset is.  After clicking on the call/put button, enter the amount you want to invest and approve the execution. The selection may be cancelled by clicking on "X" at any time before approval of the transaction. Please note that the level keeps updating in the investment sheet.</p>

             

            <h4>What return will I get for a successful investment?</h4>

            <p>A successful investment will result in a guaranteed return indicated on the site for the underlying asset that you selected. Binary Machine typically offers you a 70% – 85% payout when the option expires in-the-money.</p>

             

            <h4>What return will I get in the event that the option expires out-of-the-money?</h4>

            <p>In the event that the option expires out-of-the-money, the majority of your investment amount will be deducted automatically from your account.  You will however receive a percentage of your investment back.</p>

             

            <h4>What is the minimum amount to purchase a single option?</h4>

            <p>The minimum amount to purchase a single option is 25 EUR/USD.</p>

            <p>I tried to invest an amount for a single option, but received an error message telling me I exceeded the maximum investment amount. What should I do?</p>

            <p>If you wish to purchase options for greater amounts than 1,500 EUR/USD, you will have to purchase an option at this maximum amount, and then purchase an additional option, and so on. Multiple options may be purchased, one following the other, allowing you to effectively invest an unlimited amount per asset.</p>

            <h4>What are the levels displayed in the trading boxes?</h4>

            <h4>What happens if the expiry level of a given asset is identical to the level at which the transaction was made?</h4>

            <p>In this event, the amount of the investment is returned to the customer.</p>
