            <h4><p>What is a binary option?</p></h4>
            

            <p align="justify">A Binary Option is a vehicle that allows you to invest into the rate an asset is trading at vs the expiry time. The up and down nature of binary options makes it very easy to understand the mechanics of trading. There are none of the complications associated with traditional investments from leverage to spreads and exit points. Payouts are clearly set in advance, typically around 70% to 90% for every winning trade operation. Binary options are available 24/7 on a wide range of Currencies, Commodities, Indices and Stocks. All “trade operations” executions within our site are considered trading operations for correct data entry purposes, they are placed and set on real time as it is needed as part of the learning process for the correct data entry within our platform in order for our categorizer, tools and resources to become more accurate, taking advantage of the massive data entry of our client students.</p>
